            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Kush Patel, and I am a senior at the University of
                Massachusetts Lowell, pursuing a major in Computer Science, as well as a Math minor. I have done
                a Software Engineering coop at L3 Technologies Security and Detection, 
                as well as an internship at AutoGuide Mobile Robotics, where I currently
                work part time. I am currently taking Graphical User Interface, Database I, Organization of Programming Languages, Algorithms,
                and Calculus III. Previous courses I've taken are listed below. My skill set includes C/C++, C#, and Python. This website
                will host all of my assignments for my Graphical User Interface class. In my free time
                I enjoy PC Gaming, watching Sci-FI movies, and lifting weights.</p>
